# GTMaps

This repository contains Swift code for a demo of GTMaps, a web-mapping platform designed to impact the decision-making process of Georgia Tech students commuting to campus.

.  as well as using clustering methods to characterize adsorption site space. Both components of the project are available as [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) notebooks to make installation of software dependencies and code usage easier. Our code makes use of a [Behler-Parrinello](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.3553717) fingerprint module written in C++ from the [SIMPLE-NN package](https://github.com/MDIL-SNU/SIMPLE-NN), with most ```utils``` scripts being from or modified from [Simple-NN-BP-FP](https://github.com/yilinyang1/Simple-NN-BP-FP).
