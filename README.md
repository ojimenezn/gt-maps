# GTMaps

This repository contains Swift code for a demo of GTMaps, a web-mapping platform designed to impact the decision-making process of Georgia Tech students commuting to campus. In particular, the goal of GTMaps is to positively intervene by attempting to raise awareness about COVID, and informing them about relevant safety/costs considerations for available transportation options. This project was done to satisfy the requirements of CS6795 Introduction to Cognitive Science.
